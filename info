Oscar: Rice and food is delicious really recommend this Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh
Simon, Local Guide: Don’t miss this HIDDEN damn authentic Chinese (Szechuan) cuisine restaurant in Edinburgh. My homie from Szechuan recommended there by private. Can’t believe the restaurant will be so much amazing! And the boss, Ms Zhou is also very kind! Go there, you will be like already in the place of heaven which pandas live around even if you still in Edinburgh. Lol.
Mel mel, Local Guide: Yummy Restaurant never fails to impress with their mouthwatering dishes, especially their 'Tomato Egg'. Highly recommended!
